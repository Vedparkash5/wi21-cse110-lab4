# Part 1
1. Because this is a var, the scope is function, i would be prices.length - 1 
2. Because this is a var, the scope is function, discountedPrice will equal to prices[i]*(1-discount)
3. finalPrice will be printed out because it was declared in the scope of the function.
4. 8. [50, 100, 150], the finalPrice and discounted vars are declared in the function scope so they will be constant throughout the function call. With this information, we can see that 100,200, and 300 will be multiplied by 0.5 and then rounded to the nearest number and then divided by 100, which is the same as just multiplying them by 0.5. So 100 returns 50, 200 returns 100, and 300 returns 150.
5. An error will be thrown out because i is only in the scope of the for loop, not outside of it.
6. An error will be thrown out because discountedPrice is only in the scope of the for loop, not outside of it.
7. finalPrice will be printed out because it was declared in the scope of the function.
